# Learning-Lua
### Day 1
  The first day was spent binging tutorials to distinguish which tutorials are great and which ones could use some work. I learned very borderline material like changing the properties of objects.

### Day 2

 The second day consisted of just trying to piece together a simple game but it turns out to have more layers than I presumed. I was extremely tired anyway, so I saved the project for tomorrow and didn't write a single line of code.
