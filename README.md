# Learning-Lua
### Day 1
  The first day was spent binging tutorials to distinguish which tutorials are great and which ones could use some work. I learned very borderline material like changing the properties of objects.

### Day 2

 The second day consisted of just trying to piece together a simple game but it turns out to have more layers than I presumed. I was extremely tired anyway, so I saved the project for tomorrow and didn't write a single line of code.

### Day 4

 The fourth day, I finished the second tutorial on making a game and decided to stop recording after the first hour to not take up space on my hardrive. All I did when I stopped recording was watching more tutorials but I kept track of the time.

### Day 5

 The fifth day, I watched a few tutorials going over syntax and referencing properties and created a cool little dice game on the way. It was pretty cool and I hope to finish the playlist with an understanding of Lua.

### Day 6

 The sixth day, I decided to sort of binge about 3 tutorials and stopped half way on the third. A general overview of what I learned included "Instance.new," and functions, maybe even varialbes I think.

### Day 7

 The seventh day, I watched about 2 tutorials that went over parameters and arguements. I will be honest with you; it was confusing at first. With a little bit of practice though, I got the hang of it pretty easily.

### Day 8

 The eighth day, I watched about one tutorial and tried to rap my head around returning data between functions. I tried to mess around to get a better understanding, but I was still a little bit confused around the whole concept.

### Day 9

The ninth day, I watched one tutorial that went over built in functions in the roblox API. I found the functions useful and good to know for the future. I was planning on watching a second tutorial but the other one was an hour long compared to the other tutorials in the playlist that are 10 to 20 minutes long.

### Day 10

 The tenth day, I started watching the hour long tutorial series. It went very in depth for the time I watched it. I learned how to do basic events within the first 30 minutes of the video.

### Day 11

 The eleventh day, I watched almost all of the hour long video and figured out how to do a common gag. Which is making a player slip when you touch a certain object. An example would be a banana peel.

### Day 12

 The twelfth day, I finished the hour long video. Then I started to get into the if statements. During the way, I added a day and night cycle just for learning purposes and fun. The script will be available.

### Day 13

 The thirteenth day, I decided to watch the next video in the playlist consisting of if statements and the other was based on embedded if statements and stuff. I really liked it and hope to learn more.
